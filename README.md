###  VacationPY
Executable can be found under VacationPY/VacationPy.ipynb.  I'm not sure why the maps don't show up in Vacation like they do in Weather as they are both on my local machine.
The output csv file produced by weather was copied to VacationPY/output_data and can be found there.

### WeatherPY
Executable can be found under WeatherPy.ipynb. 
Data files created can be found under WeatherPY/output_data
